# SMFA 2.0

This project was catered towards my personal preference and research. This project is now open to public due to my decision for dropping this project after Morningstar.com changes their web design. (Not sure when tho.)

The stock exchange involved is KLSE in Malaysia only.

## Reguire
1. Python 3.10.6
2. Selenium 4.9.1
3. Selenium web driver

## Future Work
1. Started working on NASDAQ and NYSE stock exchanges.

## Final Words
Please do share if you managed to find a source similar to what Morningstar.com can provide. 
Another source that could do is "https://klse.i3investor.com/", but might need more calculations and not as much information as Morningstar.
The decision for dropping this project is not final, may come back in the future.
Hope you who tried this have fun. =D
